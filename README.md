## AIM:
To write a program to predict car prices using a linear regression model and test the assumptions for linear regression.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.

```

## Output:
![simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored](sam.png)


## Result:
Thus, the program to implement a linear regression model for predicting car prices is written and verified using Python programming, along with the testing of key assumptions for linear regression.
